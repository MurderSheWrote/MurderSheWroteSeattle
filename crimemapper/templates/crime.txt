This website represents the public data offered by the City of Seattle.
As a result, some data representing more personal infractions is unavailable
for the purpose of protecting the privacy and safety of the persons involved.

In addition, some of the data offered by the City was not included. 
This was done to furthure protect persons identities, as well as to 
filter our own data to include only categories that we found useful
to represent in this context.

If you have any questions or concerns about our data set, feel free to 
reach out to us.
